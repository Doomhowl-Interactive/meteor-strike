# Unknown World (game jam prototype)

You are a robot on an unknown planet attached to a wire that feeds you electricity.

Falling asteroids carry crystals that you need to collect in order to stay alive and keep your ship powered.

You die if your power runs out or your ship gets damaged.

The player has a gun they can use to explode the incoming asteroids. (Shooting the gun also consumes energy)
